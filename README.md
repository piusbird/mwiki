# the source code to my personal wiki

Here it is... Broken out from my hidden monorepo for the first time
Nothing special here, it just displays markdown files in the directory it's
told to. Also does .txt files.

The fancy part is it allows simple linking between documents, 
via abuse of a 404 handler.

The other fancy thing is in the frontend where we use javascript to a never before
seen extent, in the history of my personal codebase to achieve, unparelled 
comfort in editing and rich media support

# Requires rusty tools
I decided to go with a cutting edge source layout and deployment tools for 
this project as a result uv and just are required

# running
just run wikipath
